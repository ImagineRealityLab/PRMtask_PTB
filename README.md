# PRMtask_PTB
Simultaneous imagery-perceptual detection task, programmed in PsychToolBox (PTB)

the 'wrapper.m' script runs through all the practice tasks one by one, starting with detection, then imagery, then combining the two in the 'practiceMainTask.m' script. The visibility of the gratings is staircased in the 'outsideStaircase.m' script and then automatically used for the main task script later on. This version of the task only contains a congruent and an incongruent imagery condition, but no no-imagery condition. The 'practiceMainTask' script can be copied and adjusted to turn into the full main task script, with custom trial and block numbers. The data are automatically saved in a folder with the participant's name within the 'Results' folder. For more info on the task, see: https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/dgjk6.
